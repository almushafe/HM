## Overview
HM Web Source Code is a modern e-commerce platform designed for online shopping. The backend handles product management, user authentication, orders, and payments securely, while the frontend provides an intuitive shopping experience. Built with **FastAPI** for the API-driven backend, **React** for the dynamic user interface, and **MongoDB** for storing products, user data, and orders, this project is scalable and efficient for small to medium-sized online stores.

## Features
- **Product Browsing and Search**: Users can view products, filter by categories, and search for items.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add, update, or remove items from the cart with real-time updates.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login/signup for registered users, with profile management.
- **Order Management**: Place orders, view order history, and track status.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Backend admin features to add/edit products and manage inventory (basic implementation).
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface built with React for seamless shopping on any device.
- **Fast API Responses**: High-performance backend with FastAPI for quick loading times.
- [Add more if applicable, e.g., Payment Integration (Stripe/PayPal), Wishlist, Reviews]

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) - A modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.
- **Frontend**: [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Database**: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - A flexible NoSQL database for storing e-commerce data like products and orders.
- [Optional: Add others if used, e.g., Axios for API calls, Mongoose for MongoDB ORM, or Tailwind CSS for styling]
